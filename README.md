The report aims to support the student 
performance in a Portuguese secondary school 
with statistical analysis and predictions. Five
predictions were performed with different 
machine learning techniques (Logistic 
regression, Decision trees, Random Forest and 
Support Vector Machines). Recall was 
prioritized over precision as false negatives 
were to be minimized. Pass and Fail for first and 
second term exams were predicted using 
Decision Trees and Random Forest, with final 
recall results being 0.696 and 0.750 
respectively. Support Vector Machines were 
used with rbf kernels to predict the effect of 
social activities, family relationships, and 
financial background on student performance in 
final exams, with a resultant recall of 0.765 for 
both. Lastly, a Logistic Regression was used to 
determine the probability of obtaining above a 
B in grade average to provide enrichment 
activities, resulting in a recall of 0.857.
